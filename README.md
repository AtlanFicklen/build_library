# build_library



A javascript code that creates a library. Items can be added, checked in and out, and has the average rating of the item.



Created a parent class named Media that had three subclasses, a Book, a Movie or a CD. Each of these subclasses have the properties : author (string), title (string), pages (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty). Each subclass aslo has getters and the methods : .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating().
